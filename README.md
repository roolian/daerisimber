A theme extending [Timberland](https://github.com/cearls/timberland)

Timberland is an opinionated WordPress theme using [Timber](https://www.upstatement.com/timber/), [Advanced Custom Fields Pro](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Alpine.js](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine).

As of version 1.0, Timberland now uses the WordPress block editor to visually edit the site. This is made possible by the [ACF Blocks feature](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/blocks/).
